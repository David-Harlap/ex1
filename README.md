# ex1 - Weighted Graph
Assignments 1 in OOP course in Ariel University. 

The Assignments was to make undirectional weighted graph.  My graph should support a large number of nodes (over 10^6, with average degree of 10).
It was given us 3 interfaces and we needed to write 2 class Wgraph and WGraph_Algo.


### Wgraph  class 
 This graph has private inner class 'NodeInfo' that represent node in the graph. each node has unique key, tag and info Srting that can represent something. 
 
  in the graph we have some methods like 
  
  you can create weighted graph

the only way to add node is in the 'addNode' method.
